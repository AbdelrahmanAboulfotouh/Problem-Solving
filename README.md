# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **Problem Solving** repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various coding problems from popular platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, UVa, AtCoder, and CSES. The primary focus of this repository is to document my journey in improving my **problem-solving skills** through consistent practice and learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific platform. Inside each directory, you'll find my solutions to problems, along with notes and explanations to help me (and hopefully others) understand the thought process behind each solution.

## Focus on Problem-Solving Skills

While this repository includes solutions to problems from competitive programming platforms, the primary focus is on **improving problem-solving skills**. The goal is not just to solve problems quickly or to compete, but to deeply understand the underlying concepts, patterns, and techniques that can be applied to a wide range of problems.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- **Understanding the Problem**: Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developing efficient algorithms to solve problems.
- **Data Structures**: Choosing the right data structures to optimize solutions.
- **Optimization**: Improving the time and space complexity of solutions.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common patterns and applying known techniques to new problems.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Platform**: Navigate to the directory of the platform you're interested in (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces) to find solutions and notes.
2. **Read the Notes**: Each platform directory contains a `Notes.md` file with insights, tips, and common patterns specific to that platform.
3. **Explore General Notes**: The `General-Notes/` directory contains broader notes on data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques that are applicable across all platforms.
4. **Contribute**: If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional solutions, feel free to open a pull request or issue.

## Why Problem Solving?

Problem-solving is a fundamental skill in software engineering and computer science. It's not just about writing code; it's about thinking critically, breaking down complex problems, and coming up with efficient solutions. This repository is a reflection of my journey in honing these skills, and I hope it can serve as a resource for others on a similar path.

Happy coding, and may your problem-solving skills continue to grow!
