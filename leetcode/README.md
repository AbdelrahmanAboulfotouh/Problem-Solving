# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, along with detailed explanations and code implementations. As a software engineer, I regularly practice problem-solving on LeetCode to improve my coding skills, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving techniques. This repository serves as a collection of my progress and a resource for others who are also preparing for technical interviews or looking to enhance their coding skills.

## About

This repository is a personal collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution is written in a programming language of my choice (typically Python, Java, or C++), and I strive to provide clear, well-documented code along with explanations of the thought process behind each solution.

### Goals:
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** Regularly solving LeetCode problems helps me stay sharp and think critically about algorithms and data structures.
- **Document Progress:** By committing my solutions to this repository, I can track my progress over time and revisit problems to refine my solutions.
- **Share Knowledge:** I hope that my solutions and explanations can help others who are also practicing on LeetCode or preparing for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels. Each problem has its own folder containing the solution code, a README file with a detailed explanation, and any additional resources or notes.

### Folder Structure:
- **Easy:** Solutions to problems categorized as "Easy" on LeetCode.
- **Medium:** Solutions to problems categorized as "Medium" on LeetCode.
- **Hard:** Solutions to problems categorized as "Hard" on LeetCode.

Each problem folder contains:
- **Solution Code:** The actual code implementation of the solution.
- **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken to solve it, and the time and space complexity analysis.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Difficulty:** Navigate to the appropriate difficulty folder (Easy, Medium, Hard) to find solutions to problems of that level.
2. **Explore Problem Folders:** Each problem has its own folder containing the solution code and a README file with a detailed explanation.
3. **Run the Code:** You can copy the code and run it in your local environment or on LeetCode's online editor to test it.
4. **Learn from Explanations:** The README files provide insights into the thought process behind each solution, including the approach, algorithm used, and complexity analysis.

### Example:
If you're looking for a solution to the "Two Sum" problem (an Easy problem), navigate to the `Easy/Two-Sum/` folder. There, you'll find the solution code (`solution.py`) and a `README.md` file explaining the problem and the solution.
